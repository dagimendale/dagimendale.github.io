# About Me
Welcome to my personal portfolio showcasing my work and projects in cybersecurity. I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in risk management, network security, cloud solutions, and more. With a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity and a Master’s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance currently in progress, I have developed hands-on expertise in using tools like Splunk, Wireshark, Kali Linux, Azure, and AWS to design and implement effective security measures.

Through various projects, including threat detection systems, penetration testing, and cloud security solutions, I have honed my ability to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and build robust defense strategies. My passion for securing digital environments and protecting sensitive data drives me to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and cybersecurity trends.

I aim to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative cybersecurity solutions while continually expanding my expertise in the ever-evolving field of security.I specialize in network security, cloud solutions, and risk management, with hands-on experience in using tools like Splunk, Azure, and Kali Linux.

## Featured Projects

### Securing Cloud Apps within Azure


### Splunk Defense Project
In this project, I designed a **custom monitoring environment using Splunk** to protect a fictional organization. I created custom reports, alerts, dashboards, and add-on apps to monitor and defend against cybersecurity threats. After experiencing a **simulated attack**, I analyzed the results to assess the effectiveness of my solutions.

### Bootcon Project
In this project, I demonstrated the use of AxCrypt, a file encryption tool, to safeguard sensitive data against exfiltration. I showcased encryption and decryption processes, key-sharing capabilities, and real-life applications such as securing emails and sensitive data (e.g., credit card information). The project highlighted AxCrypt's use of AES-256 encryption and its value in modern cybersecurity practices.

### Penetration Test Report
As part of a comprehensive penetration testing engagement for a fictional organization, Rekall Corporation, I identified and exploited vulnerabilities across their technical infrastructure over three phases:
- **Part 1: Web Application Penetration Testing**  
  Conducted reconnaissance and exploited vulnerabilities in Rekall's web application using tools like Burp Suite and FoxyProxy. Uncovered 15 hidden flags categorized by difficulty and documented findings along with mitigation strategies.
- **Part 2: Linux Server Penetration Testing**  
  Focused on Rekall's Linux server infrastructure, utilizing tools like Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit to identify vulnerabilities. Uncovered multiple flags through scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation, providing actionable recommendations for Linux server security.
- **Part 3: Windows Server Penetration Testing**  
  Targeted Rekall's Windows infrastructure, including Windows 10 and Server 2019 systems. Exploited vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit and Windows utilities, identifying flags across attack phases such as reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. Addressed real-world concerns like weak password policies, outdated software, and insecure file sharing.

This project provided hands-on experience with real-world penetration testing techniques and emphasized the importance of documenting vulnerabilities and proposing mitigations.
